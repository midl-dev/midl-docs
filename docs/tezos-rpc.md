# Tezos RPC Service

Tezos RPC Service unleashes your creativity on Tezos. Focus on your Web 3 application, and leave running the nodes to us.

Our full nodes are operated on top of a cloud-based platform. This guarantees highly redundant and reliable infrastructure with 24/7 monitoring.

We are multi-cloud and multi-region. Our geographical load-balancing directs you to the point-of-presence closest to you, while ensuring reliability.

Our current points of presence are:

* North America (Digitalocean Toronto)
* Europe (Digitalocean Amsterdam)

All our plans include complimentary testnet ([Ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet)) endpoints.
