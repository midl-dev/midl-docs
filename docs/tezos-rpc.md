# Tezos RPC Service

Tezos RPC Service unleashes your creativity on Tezos. Focus on your Web 3 application, and leave running the nodes to us.


## The MIDL.dev Platform

Our full nodes are operated on top of a cloud-based platform. This guarantees highly redundant and reliable infrastructure with 24/7 monitoring.

We are multi-cloud and multi-region. Our geographical load-balancing directs you to the point-of-presence closest to you, while ensuring reliability.

Our current points of presence are:

* North America (Digitalocean Toronto)
* Europe (Digitalocean Amsterdam)

All our plans include complimentary testnet ([Ghostnet](https://teztnets.xyz/ghostnet)) endpoints.

## Archive nodes

We support **archive queries**. Our innovative load balancing system routes queries between:

* fast "rolling nodes" containing only recent data, optimized for speed,
* "archive nodes" containing all data since Tezos genesis, ideal for running indexers.

It is all transparent to you: any RPC endpoint on our platform supports archive queries.

Some queries may be priced differently. See [Pricing](tezos-rpc-pricing).
